        JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a
        multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
        functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text,
        arrays, dates, and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O,
        such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these
        upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

        Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities,
        JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different
        semantics.

        The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics
        and design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages.
